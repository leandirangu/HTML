			For mine I used my own gluten free flour blend and as it was 110°F that day and I was going to be delivering cupcakes I stabilized the whipped cream with agar powder rather than milk powder. For the cupcakes I injected the filling.Amazigly light and fluffy while still rich and chocolaty with not too much sweetness. This is by and far my favorite black forest cake recipie.
			As a German woman, it breaks my heart to see all of these black forest cakes in North America made with sickeningly sweet icing and gross cherry pie filling.This cake isnt meant to be very sweet but is rather a dessert for adults with deep rich flavours and enough alcohol to make your head spin! If you cannot get fresh.As far as I know, this cake recipe can be traced back to my German great-grandma. When I got married, my mother gave me a copy and I hope to someday pass it down to my children. —Stephanie Travis, Fallon, Nevada.Under all the whipped cream icing of the Black Forest cake are three layers of chocolate génoise soaked in kirsch. My father finished his génoise by hand, using a huge whisk with widely spaced wires to fold the flour and then the butter into the batter with big, efficient strokes so it would not deflate.

			In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of aesthetic appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of landscape painting. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been landscaped,[1] though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.
			The word landscape (landscipe or landscaef) arrived in England—and therefore into the English language—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term landscape emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery.[2] Land (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English).[3] The suffix ‑scape is equivalent to the more common English suffix ‑ship.[3] The roots of ‑ship are etymologically akin to Old English sceppan or scyppan, meaning to shape. The suffix ‑schaft is related to the verb schaffen, so that ‑ship and shape are also etymologically linked.
